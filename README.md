# simple-algorithms
The project is aimed at providing solutions to the algorithmic problems.

## Getting started
This project is created in Java 8. Each problem has been provided with a set of test cases, to check its correctness. 
The test cases are created using Junit 4. Import the project in your favourite IDE, add junit to the classpath to test.

Problems
1. [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) 
The solution aims at finding the winner in O(1), using O(2n+2) = O(n) space, where nxn is the tic tac toe board. 
It keeps a track of users movement across each row and column and the diagonal to find the winning streak.
